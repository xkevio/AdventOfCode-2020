# AdventOfCode-2020 in C++


Hello Dear Reader, this is my very own attempt at solving this years Advent of Code. At the same time I am using this years challenges to learn and reinforce my C++ language skills! 
This repo is a work-in-progress to fully cover all challenges. So have fun with it and tell me how to improve my C++ if you'd like.


### Current Status

- [x] Day 1
- [x] Day 2
- [x] Day 3
- [x] Day 4

## How do I compile the solutions?

You simply clone the repository, head into the solution you want to see and use whatever C++ Compiler you're familiar with. I personally use `g++` for Windows, so simply compile with `g++ .\main.cpp`.
Afterwards you will have an executable called `a.exe` which you can just open via the terminal. The inputs for each day are included.


### Example:
```
git clone https://github.com/xkevio/adventofcode-2020.git
cd adventofcode_2020/day_1
g++ .\main.cpp
.\a.exe
```
